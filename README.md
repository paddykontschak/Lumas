# Frontend Task
## Create a Star Rating Component
**Objective:** Build a star rating component that lets users rate artworks on a scale of 1 to 5 stars in the
following categories:
* "Fits to my Wall"
* “Thats my Style"
* “Enjoy this Artist"

You can implement this task using Vue 3 or Web Components (native HTML + JavaScript). Choose
the approach you’re most comfortable with.

## Requirements
### 1 Categories:
* The component should display the three categories: "Fits to my Wall", "Style", and "Artist".
* Each category should have its own set of 5 stars.
### 2 Interactive Star Rating:
* Users should be able to click on a star to set the rating for that category.
* Hovering over the stars should visually indicate the potential rating.
### 3 Live Feedback:
* The selected rating should update in real-time when the user clicks a star.
* Display the numerical rating (e.g., "4/5") beside or below the stars for each category.
### 4 Reusable Component:
* Create a reusable component or custom element that handles the star rating logic and UI.
### 5 Styling:
* Use basic styling for the stars (e.g., filled and empty states).
* You can use emojis (
⭐
) or CSS shapes for the stars.
* Ensure the design is visually clean and user-friendly.
### 6 Optional Bonus (if time permits):
* Add a "Submit" button that logs the ratings for all categories to the console.
* Include basic responsiveness to ensure the component works well on both desktop and mobile
devices.
